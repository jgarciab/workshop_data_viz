# Workshop on data visualization

Data visualization is more than just pretty charts; it's a powerful way to convey complex information clearly and efficiently. Understanding the significance of visual storytelling can greatly enhance decision-making and communication. In this workshop, you'll not only grasp why data visualization is pivotal but also dive into its core principles. By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to turn data into clear and engaging visuals, no matter your starting point.


In the morning you will learn and apply the perception, design and storytellings principles that allow you to create effective and efficient visualizations, and you will craft engaging visuals with your own datasets. In the afternoon you will learn how to create interactive visualizations and apps using `hvPlot` and `panel`.
