# Workshop on data visualization

Data visualization is more than just pretty charts; it's a powerful way to convey complex information clearly and efficiently. Understanding the significance of visual storytelling can greatly enhance decision-making and communication. In this workshop, you'll not only grasp why data visualization is pivotal but also dive into its core principles. By the end of the workshop, you'll be able to turn data into clear and engaging visuals, no matter your starting point.


In the morning you will learn and apply the perception, design and storytellings principles that allow you to create effective and efficient visualizations, and you will craft engaging visuals with your own datasets. In the afternoon you will learn how to create interactive visualizations and apps using `hvPlot` and `panel`.

- [Slides afternoon](https://github.com/jgarciab/workshop_data_viz/raw/main/advanced_2025/slides/20251127_interactive.pdf) on interactive data visualization.


Run the code without installing anything:
- On [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jgarciab/workshop_data_viz/HEAD)
- On Google Colab: [![Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jgarciab/workshop_data_viz) (you will need to install the libraries manually, e.g. `!pip install hvplot panel jupyter_bokeh`, but you don't lose your work if you make a copy of the notebook. You'll also need to wrap the hvplot objects using pn.panel, e.g., `pn.panel(scatter)` and upload the data manually).
