## Summary
### DATA VISUALIZATION
- Efficient and effective to show data â€”> Reduce cognitive load

### WHY DO WE WANT TO REDUCE COGNITIVE LOAD
- More willing to read your paper
- More likely to understand the data/results
- More willing to accept the results
- More likely to remember them

### HOW TO DO IT?
- Use effective channels and graphical objects
- Use the CRAP (contrast, repetition, alignment, proximity) principles of design
  - Contrast: Remove clutter and focus attention
- Tell a story
